# Ipsum

Welcome to the development repository for the default theme that will launch with [WordPress 7.2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/7-2/).

## About

Ipsum is a blank canvas built around the blogging experience, our proposal for what a default theme should be. Named after *lorem ipsum*, the placeholder that fills a page until real content arrives, it is composed enough to stand on its own and to be transformed the moment people start writing.

Ipsum is built as a [block theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/block-theme-overview/). The theme aims to ship with as little CSS as possible: our goal is for all theme styles to be configured through [`theme.json`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/) and editable through Global Styles. The theme development team will work closely with [Gutenberg](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) contributors to build design tools in the block editor that enable this goal.

## Try Ipsum

- **[Open Ipsum in WordPress Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/ipsum/trunk/.github/blueprint.json)** — a throwaway WordPress in your browser with Ipsum active and the demo content already imported. Nothing to install; close the tab and it's gone.
- **[Browse the demo site](https://ipsum.mystagingwebsite.com/)** — the theme with the same content, hosted.
- **Install it** — download this repository as a ZIP (Code → Download ZIP) or clone it into `wp-content/themes/ipsum`, then activate Ipsum under Appearance → Themes. Requires WordPress 7.1 or later and PHP 7.4 or later.

## Demo content

The posts and pages used in the screenshots and the demo site are in [`ipsum-demo-content.xml`](.github/ipsum-demo-content.xml). Import them on a test site via Tools → Import → WordPress. The Playground link above loads them for you.

## Contributing

Ipsum is being developed in the open. Feedback is welcome — [open an issue](https://github.com/WordPress/ipsum/issues) with anything you find, from bugs to design notes. The style variations, the archive pattern pack, and the sidebar templates are the areas where testing helps most right now.

Contributing is not just for developers! There are many opportunities to help with [testing](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started), triage, discussion, design, building patterns and templates, and more.

Two conventions for contributors: the theme version stays at 1.0.0 while Ipsum is in development, and changes are logged in pull request descriptions rather than a changelog.
